#### Hedge Funds and Fund Accounting Overview
1. **What is a Hedge Fund?**
   - Hedge funds are investment funds pooling capital from accredited investors to invest in diverse asset classes such as equities, bonds, commodities, and money markets.
   - Initially focused on risk reduction, modern hedge funds undertake higher-risk strategies to maximize returns.
